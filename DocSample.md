# Markdown Practice

## Styling Text

This is normal text.

This is **bold** text.

I have added more **bold text**. 

This is *italicized* text.

**This is _extremely_ important text**.

This is a ~~strikethrough~~ text.

## Quoting Text

This is how to quote a text. Some of my favourite quotes are below.

> The harder I work, the luckier I get.

> The more I have, the more I can give away.

## Quoting Code

Here's a way to quote code for easy viewing.

Use `git status` to check a file's status.

Use `git checkout main` to get back to the main branch.

## Organizing Data

Here's how you can make a table. It can be quite laborious making a table in markdown.

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1 | Cell 2 |
| Cell 3 | Cell 4 |

<details>

<summary> This is a collapsed section </summary>

# Heading 1

I can add text here.

# Heading 2

I can add images and block quotes.

</details>
