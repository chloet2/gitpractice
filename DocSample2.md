# Learning Git and GitHub for Beginners

## Basic Git and GitHub Concepts

Here are some basic concepts you must know to get started with Git and GitHub.

**Repository** is like a storage place where you store all the items you need for your project (this could be files, folders, images, code, etc.). This is known as the main branch. T

A **branch** is a duplicate of your main branch (or repository). Users make changes to the duplicate repository to avoid affecting the main branch if they make mistakes. This is useful for lots of coding and changes. Think of these branches as drafts to be reviewed before the changes are pasted into the main document.

**Pull** requests are requests to merge the changes into the main branch.

To save changes in GitHub is called to **commit** a change.

Once the requests are approved, the changes are **committed** to the main branch, then the duplicate branches are deleted to avoid confusion.

**Git** and **GitHub** are different things. Git is a version control system. Multiple people can work on the same files locally and update them remotely into a single file. GitHub hosts files being worked on. Files worked on locally saves space and multiple people can work on different versions of the file with the same name without causing problems to the original document.

## Basic Git Commands

Some basic Git commands to remember.

| Git Command | Function |
| -------- | -------- |
| `git status`| Checks the version of git you have your computer |
| `git add .` | Stages the changes in the file. |
| `git commit -m` | Commits the changes in the file and lets you add a description of what the changes are about|
| `git push origin` | Reuploads the file to your main branch in GitHub. |
| `git log --oneline` | Summarizes the change log into separae lines of one line each. |

## Something Motivational

Whenever you feel discouraged about your progress learning Git and using the command line, just remember that:
